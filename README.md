# s3m.it

The fuel that powers the s3m.it compo system. Not the nicest code you've ever seen, but at least it's rather structured and well-documented. Now you can finally search for evil h4x to find out who made a tune before the results are out!
Should probably work with any version of PHP 7.

`php/settings.php` would like to know your MySQL / MariaDB credentials.

Most code by Saga Musix (https://sagamusix.de/), voting system by coda (https://coda.s3m.us/).
