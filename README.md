# s3m.it

The fuel that powers the s3m.it compo system. Not the nicest code you've ever seen, but at least it's rather structured and well-documented. Now you can finally search for evil h4x to find out who made a tune before the results are out!
Requires PHP 5 with mysqlnd and MySQL. PHP 7 probably also works.

`php/settings.php` would like to know your MySQL credentials.

Most code by Saga Musix (http://sagamusix.de/), voting system by coda (http://coda.s3m.us/).
